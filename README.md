# NATO Alphabet Converter

Small Python project that converts words into the NATO phonetic alphabet using a CSV file.

## Main features

- Reads the NATO phonetic alphabet from a CSV file.
- Asks the user to enter a word.
- Outputs the list of code words, e.g. `HELLO` → `Hotel Echo Lima Lima Oscar`.
- Handles both upper and lower case input.

## What I learned

- Reading CSV files with `pandas`.
- Building dictionaries from tabular data.
- Using list and dictionary comprehensions.
- Basic input handling and validation.

## How to run

Open `main.py` in Python 3 and run the file.
